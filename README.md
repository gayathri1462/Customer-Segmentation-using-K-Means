# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means

The K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.
In this notebook, We use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

Customer segmentation
Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
Pattern recognition
Machine learning
Data compression

In this notebook we use k-means clustering with 2 examples:
