# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means

The K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.
In this notebook, We use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

Customer segmentation
Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
Pattern recognition
Machine learning
Data compression

In this notebook we use k-means clustering with 2 examples:

1)k-means on a random generated dataset
2)Using k-means for customer segmentation

=> Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retaining those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations. And so on.
